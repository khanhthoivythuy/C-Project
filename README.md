This is a project I had in Computer Science course at University. The work is the C program using Runge-Kutta 4th order method to simulate a double pendulum system as described in the file Pendulum-System-Project.pdf 
It calculates and analyzes the periods of motion by varying the length and mass ratios of the pendulum arms.
Features:
Implements RK4 numerical integration for solving the equations of motion.
Simulates double pendulum dynamics by varying: Length ratios (from 0.2 to 2) and Mass ratios (from 0.2 to 2).
Computes and prints the periods of oscillation for both pendulums.
